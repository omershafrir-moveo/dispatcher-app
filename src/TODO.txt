TODOS:

2. fix style of searchBox + filter : rounded edges, borders, to make it look like 1 component
3. add logo to header
4. fix style of header to look like in figma


DropDown:
- cant chnage attributes of scrollbar: color, background and visibillity.
- change color of scrollbar
- ask roey about margins: how do i know from the figma the small details in between components( like margin)


RecentSearches:
- IMPORTANT: when user clicks on 'x' in the recent searches- to stop the event propogation to the Item container that wraps it ( since it is also a button).


InputSearchBar: 
- IMPORTANT: what happens when both the recentSearches and the FilterDropdown are opened ?


import { useContext } from 'react'
import { SearchContext } from "../SearchContext/SearchContext";
const { } = useContext(SearchContext);



continue:
1. fix clicks on/out search bar
2. fix clicks on/out filter
3. connect states to search bar and filter box
4. connect handlers to search bar and filter box

* handleBlur of filter interrupts state assignment of filter
* handle vent propogation for recent searches items to work.

  const {page,searchQuery} = useContext(SearchContext)

  const callApi = async () => {
    const res = await axios.get(`url/q=${searchQuery}&page=${page}`);
    setArtciels(res))

export type articlesLayoutProps = {
  articles: ArticleProps[];
  filters: { filter: string; value: string }[];
};

^^^
1. type of filters here is just string, but in the filterSelect Component it is an object with key, title, value.
2. what should be the title above the articles list ?
3. finish body layout.
4. organize all filter/sort data in a well organized DS.
3. filter by / sort by ?
4. impl Date filter/sort
5. where all the calculations for the widgets occur? option: each widget calculates the data at its component 
6. top headlines in israel - default -  add condition for viewing it
7. combine context with filters layout. specifically - each filter needs to get it's state value and set function, from parent or context.
8. need to add 2 special buttons in the start of the toolbar : sort by & dates
