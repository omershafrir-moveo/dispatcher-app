ask noy:
1. white at the bottom of app  :
what dims should i have?
4. pie graph scroller for legend
6. dates widget - fix.
9. implement loading states? foir articles layout and for widgets.



***:

questions:

1. if a user picks for instance country and then switches from tio-headlines to everything - should his filters selections should be reset?

notes:
left the reactQueries in body layout because i need the articles data at body layout because of the headlines.
but i removed the usage of a state.

what does not work :
top headlines without q/language/category/country/sources
everything without q/sources

therefore:
if user is on top headlines - the default search is country=Israel 
if user is on everything - the default is q=israel ( as long as sources/q are not selected)

error message for empty searches:
: Required parameters are missing, the scope of your search is too broad. 
Please set any of the following required parameters and try again: q, qInTitle, sources, domains."







KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. Before writing types for the app: inspect the API and all other relevant data that might influence the types.
