TODOS:

2. fix style of searchBox + filter : rounded edges, borders, to make it look like 1 component
3. add logo to header
4. fix style of header to look like in figma


DropDown:
- cant chnage attributes of scrollbar: color, background and visibillity.
- change color of scrollbar
- ask roey about margins: how do i know from the figma the small details in between components( like margin)


RecentSearches:
- IMPORTANT: when user clicks on 'x' in the recent searches- to stop the event propogation to the Item container that wraps it ( since it is also a button).


InputSearchBar: 
- IMPORTANT: what happens when both the recentSearches and the FilterDropdown are opened ?


import { useContext } from 'react'
import { SearchContext } from "../SearchContext/SearchContext";
const { } = useContext(SearchContext);



continue:
1. fix clicks on/out search bar
2. fix clicks on/out filter
3. connect states to search bar and filter box
4. connect handlers to search bar and filter box
